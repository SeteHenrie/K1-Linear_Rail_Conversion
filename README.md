# K1-Linear_Rail_Conversion
This repository includes several designs and instruction for the implementation of linear rails on the Creality K1 3D printer. 

IMPORTANT: These designs are made specifically for the K1, and were not tested on the K1 Max, or the K1C.
Instalation of this mod does not guarantee better preformance and may void your warranty.
I am not liable for damage to any machines. 

I recomend using the parts listed in the Bill of Materials as I have had the best success using those parts, however using other brands should still work.
