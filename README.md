# K1-Linear_Rail_Conversion
This repository includes several designs and instruction for the implementation of linear rails on the Creality K1 3D printer. 

IMPORTANT: These designs are made specifically for the K1, and were not tested on the K1 Max, or the K1C.
Instalation of this mod does not guarantee better preformance and may void your warranty.
I am not liable for damage to any machines. 

I recomend using the parts listed in the Bill of Materials as I have had the best success using those parts, however using other brands should still work. 
Some of the parts, specifically the carbon and aluminum extrusion, have to be cut drilled and tapped. I reccomend purchasing these parts through me if possible. Im based in the US and 
am working on getting an online store setup, but for now you can just email me at setehenrie@gmail.com if you are interested in purchasing premade parts. Transactions would be made through paypall.

For instructions on how to dissasemble the printer to have access to the gantry for replacement, visit https://github.com/nurbs999/K1-Linear_Rail_Conversion/blob/disassemble_guide/Disassemble.md
